# SimpleHTTPServer

A Ruby based Simple HTTP Server that's not so simple after all.

## Current Status:

This started out as a fun little experiment last summer when I was playing around a lot with `netcat` and Ruby based web servers. Unfortunately, it has stayed just that, an incomplete experimental prototype.

At the moment, it's able to handle a basic request and response along with some minimum logging.

I would love to come back to finish it someday, but I don't think it'll be anytime soon. :cry:
